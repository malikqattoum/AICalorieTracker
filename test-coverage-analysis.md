# Test Coverage Analysis

## Current Test Structure

### Unit Tests
1. **Issue**: Limited unit test coverage for critical business logic.
2. **Risk**: Bugs in core functionality may not be caught before deployment.
3. **Evidence**: Only a few test files are visible (auth.test.ts, meal-analysis.test.ts) and they focus primarily on API endpoints rather than business logic.

### Integration Tests
1. **Issue**: Limited integration testing between components.
2. **Risk**: Issues with component interactions may not be detected.
3. **Evidence**: Tests appear to focus on individual endpoints rather than workflows.

### End-to-End Tests
1. **Issue**: No evidence of end-to-end testing.
2. **Risk**: User workflows may not be fully tested.
3. **Evidence**: No E2E test frameworks (like Cypress or Puppeteer) are visible in dependencies.

## Test Coverage Gaps

### Authentication Tests
1. **Issue**: Tests cover basic registration and login but not edge cases.
2. **Risk**: Vulnerabilities in authentication flow may not be detected.
3. **Evidence**: auth.test.ts tests basic functionality but doesn't cover password reset, session expiration, or failed login attempts.

### AI Service Tests
1. **Issue**: No tests for AI service integration.
2. **Risk**: Issues with food analysis may not be detected until production.
3. **Evidence**: No test files specifically for AI service integration are visible.

### Database Tests
1. **Issue**: No tests for database operations or migrations.
2. **Risk**: Database-related issues may not be caught before deployment.
3. **Evidence**: No database-specific test files are visible.

### Mobile App Tests
1. **Issue**: Limited mobile app test coverage.
2. **Risk**: Mobile-specific issues may not be detected.
3. **Evidence**: Only one test file (LoginScreen.test.tsx) is visible for the mobile app.

### Admin Functionality Tests
1. **Issue**: No tests for admin functionality.
2. **Risk**: Admin features may be unreliable.
3. **Evidence**: No admin-specific test files are visible.

### Error Handling Tests
1. **Issue**: Limited testing of error conditions.
2. **Risk**: Error handling may not work as expected in production.
3. **Evidence**: Tests focus on successful scenarios rather than error conditions.

## Test Quality Issues

### Test Data Management
1. **Issue**: Test data management approach is not clear.
2. **Risk**: Tests may interfere with each other or leave residual data.
3. **Evidence**: auth.test.ts shows basic cleanup but no comprehensive test data strategy.

### Test Environment Isolation
1. **Issue**: No evidence of proper test environment isolation.
2. **Risk**: Tests may affect each other or production data.
3. **Evidence**: Tests appear to use the same database as development.

### Test Performance
1. **Issue**: Tests may be slow due to database operations.
2. **Risk**: Slow tests can slow down development.
3. **Evidence**: Tests perform actual database operations without mocking.

## Recommendations
