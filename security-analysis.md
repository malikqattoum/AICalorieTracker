# Security Analysis of AICalorieTracker

## Authentication Security

### Password Handling
1. **Issue**: The system appears to use bcrypt for password hashing (based on dependencies), but the implementation details are not fully visible.
2. **Risk**: If not properly implemented, password hashing could be vulnerable to attacks.
3. **Evidence**: The auth.test.ts file shows test users with example hashed passwords, but the actual hashing implementation is not visible.

### Session Management
1. **Issue**: The system uses express-session with a memory store for development.
2. **Risk**: MemoryStore is not designed for production environments and will leak memory. It also doesn't scale across multiple server instances.
3. **Evidence**: In server/storage.ts, a MemoryStore is created and used for sessions.

### Token Storage
1. **Issue**: Mobile app uses SecureStore for tokens, which is appropriate, but web app session storage mechanism is not clear.
2. **Risk**: If sessions are not properly secured on the web client, it could lead to session hijacking.

## Data Handling Security

### Sensitive Data Exposure
1. **Issue**: Database credentials and API keys are stored in environment variables.
2. **Risk**: If environment variables are not properly secured, sensitive data could be exposed.
3. **Evidence**: drizzle.config.ts contains database credentials, and server/config.ts shows various API keys.

### Data Encryption
1. **Issue**: The system has an ENCRYPTION_KEY configuration but it's set to a default value in non-production environments.
2. **Risk**: Using default encryption keys makes data vulnerable to decryption if the key is known.
3. **Evidence**: server/config.ts shows a default encryption key that should be changed in production.

### Input Validation
1. **Issue**: Some endpoints may lack proper input validation.
2. **Risk**: Without proper validation, the system is vulnerable to injection attacks.
3. **Evidence**: The routes.ts file shows some validation with Zod, but not all endpoints may be properly validated.

## API Security

### Authentication Checks
1. **Issue**: Some admin endpoints have TODO comments for admin checks.
2. **Risk**: Without proper authorization checks, unauthorized users might access admin functionality.
3. **Evidence**: In routes.ts, there are TODO comments for adding admin checks to site content management endpoints.

### Rate Limiting
1. **Issue**: No evidence of rate limiting implementation.
2. **Risk**: Without rate limiting, the system is vulnerable to brute force attacks and denial of service.
3. **Evidence**: No rate limiting middleware is visible in the server configuration.

## Recommendations

1. **Replace MemoryStore**: Use a production-ready session store like connect-redis or connect-mongo for session management.

2. **Strengthen Environment Variable Security**: 
   - Ensure environment variables are never committed to version control
   - Use a secrets management system in production
   - Rotate API keys regularly

3. **Improve Encryption Key Management**:
   - Generate strong, unique encryption keys for production
   - Store encryption keys securely (e.g., using a secrets management service)
   - Never use default encryption keys in production

4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting middleware to protect against brute force and DoS attacks.

5. **Complete Authorization Checks**: Implement proper admin checks for all admin endpoints.

6. **Enhance Input Validation**: Ensure all endpoints have proper input validation using Zod or similar validation libraries.

7. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages that could be sent to clients.

8. **Add Security Headers**: Implement security headers (Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.) to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

9. **Regular Security Audits**: Implement a process for regular security audits and vulnerability scanning.

10. **Secure Token Storage for Web**: Ensure web sessions use secure, httpOnly, and sameSite cookies.
